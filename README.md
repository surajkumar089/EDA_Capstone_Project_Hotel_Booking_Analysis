# EDA_Capstone_Project_Hotel_Booking_Analysis

⋗ The data collection includes information on when the reservation was made, how many nights they stayed, the numbers of adults, kids or babies and the number of parking spaces, among other things, for both a city hotel and a resort hotel. 

⋗ The identical data was gathered for both hotels: 79,300 observations for the resort, each described by 32 variables. 119,390 hotel reservations, including those that were cancelled, are included in the dataset. All components that could identify hotels or clients were removed because these are the genuine data. 

⋗ Perform data wrangling on the raw data as the initial step. Data cleaning removed any misleading information that would have impacted the data set’s outcome. While cleaning the data, we removed duplicates values & columns took care of lost values, switched columns to the proper data type, and added critical columns.

⋗ We utilized Matplotlib and the Seaborn libraries to define data in graph formats such as scatterplots, barplots, boxplots, countplots, pycharts, lineplots and seaborn for various types of analysis. Overall, I found that hotel bookings tend to peak in the summer months and during major holidays. I also found that customers who book early tend to stay longer and pay more than those who book closer to their travel dates. Based on these findings, I recommended that hoteliers offer discounts for early bookings in order to encourage longer stays.
